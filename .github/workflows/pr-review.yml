          The Protocol Liaison detected an issue in either the Smart Contract logic or the Frontend build.
          
          **Required Action:**
          1. **Inspect logs**: Review the build logs for specific errors.
          2. **Logical Alignment**: Ensure both sub-projects compile successfully.
          3. **Stay in Sync**: Ensure your local environment is synchronized with the upstream project. Run:
             \`\`\`bash
             git fetch origin
             git pull origin main
             \`\`\`
          4. Sync your fork on GitHub and pull the latest changes to your local branch.
          5. Push a fix to re-trigger the automated review.
          
          *Merging is restricted until the protocol aligns.*"
